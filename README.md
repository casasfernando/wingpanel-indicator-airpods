## About

Wingpanel AirPods is a status indicator that displays Apple's AirPods status information in elementary OS Wingpanel.

Being this one of my first Vala applications I'm sure that the code can be improved, so:

- If you find any problems while running the application please report it through an issue.
- Pull requests and translations are welcome.
- Feedback and suggestions are always welcome as well.

### Features:

- Displays AirPods connection status
- Displays AirPods battery charge percentage in the indicator
- Displays battery charge status per AirPod and also for the charging case in the popover
- Notifys the user when the AirPods battery or case is running low
- Supports media player playback control using AirPods in-ear detection:
    - Stop the audio: remove both AirPods from your ears, or if youâ€™re wearing just one, remove it. If you return one to your ear within 15 seconds, play resumes automatically.
    - Pause the audio: while listening with both AirPods, remove one. When you return it to your ear, playback resumes automatically.
- Supports battery saver mode to preserve battery life while the system is running on battery (e.g. laptops) *

\* In order to preserve system battery life some indicator features (e.g. media player playback control using AirPods in-ear detection) will be disabled and AirPods battery level report may be less accurate

### Requirements

- elementary OS 5.1.7 Hera
- Bluetooth 4.0 adapter with BLE support
